# Gateway Device Application (Connected Devices)

## Lab Module 12 - Semester Project Proposal

### Description

On the following page(s), be sure to address the following four topics: 
- What - The Problem
- Why - Who Cares?
- How - Expected Technical Approach
- Results - Expected Outcomes


### What - The Problem 

NOTE: Write one or two paragraphs to answer EACH of the following questions.

What problem are you trying to solve and why does it matter?


### Why - Who Cares? 

Why do you care about this particular problem? 
 

### How - Expected Technical Approach

NOTE: Provide a high level design diagram depicting your planned technical approach. This should be a relatively
simple block diagram - you do NOT need to create a UML diagram for the proposal, although you should provide
specifics on which protocols you plan to use, where they’ll be used, and how you plan to communicate between
your constrained device, gateway device, and cloud services. You may make changes to this for the final
implementation if needed - this should serve merely as a guide. 

 
### Results - Expected Outcomes 

NOTE: Write one or two paragraphs to answer the following question.

If your project is successful, what outcome do you expect (e.g. what will happen if everything works)?
